# Deep Learning Experiments

Code for reproducing results posted on my [blog](http://raghakot.github.io/). 

## Dependencies

* Keras
* Tensorflow, latest from source.

## Experiments

`cifar10.py` contains common training code.

### [Exploring alternative neural computational models](https://raghakot.github.io/2017/01/03/Exploring-alternative-neural-computational-models.html)

* Run `exp1/train.py`

### [Baking rotational invariance into a neuron](https://raghakot.github.io/2017/01/09/Baking-rotational-invariance-into-a-neuron.html)

* Run in `exp2/train.py`
* Use `exp2/explore.py` to generate plots.
